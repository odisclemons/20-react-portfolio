          <p>
            I have had a love for computers since the age of 13. My high school
            was woefully outdated when it came to technology, but it worked in
            my favor. I got to learn the ins and outs of msdos and pc dos in the
            late 90s on computers as old as the IBM 286. I got to use the IBM
            dosshell and early versions of Windows (im talking version 2.8 and
            3.1) long after they were obselete. I didnt care; I just loved the
            technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first time I realized that you could type instructions into a
            screen and make a computer do things was after reading the msdos
            manual. I learned what was called batch scripting (similar to bash
            scripting, but without all the useful parts). I learned to modify
            the autoexec.bat file and customize how my pc booted up. This was
            back in the days when Windows was just a program that ran on DOS.
            Good times.
          </p>

          <p>
            My first actual programs were written in MS Quick BASIC. You could
            create games and all kinds of things in BASIC and even compile them
            to executable programs! This fascinated me for some reason and
            fueled a lifelong obsession with computer code.
          </p>

          <p>
            At some point, I discovered girls and the Sony Playstation, and my
            little BASIC programs went by the wayside. Eventually, I learned
            enough Visual Basic to make some simple Windows applications and a
            Microsoft Access database.
          </p>

          <p>
            My first program that people other than myself used was a Microsoft
            Access database with a nice front end for the Passaic Police. They
            loved it and they used it for years after I had received another job
            offer and stopped supporting it. I eventually learned the LAMP stack
            and rewrote it in PHP 5. I loved PHP and became fascinated that I
            could deploy my own web server from scratch. After a while, I left
            coding alone again to focus on IT work and learn Linux. I tried to
            daily drive an Arch Linux build on a Microsoft network running
            Active Directory lol. HUGE mistake. I would break it at least once a
            week and have to rebuild the system from scratch, much to the
            annoyance of the IT director who wished I would just use Windows
            like a normal person. That experience was valuable though, because I
            learned how operatings systems are put together. I learned about the
            init system, desktop environments, boot loaders, partitions, all of
            the stuff. It was all valuable experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fast forward to 2017. I was trying to build a very ambitious PHP app
            and tried to get another developer to help. I'll never forget his
            words because they literally changed my life: "Bruh... why you
            working so hard? You dont gotta build everything from scratch. Just
            use a framework." A framework! I had never thought of that. I could
            take advantage of libraries and frameworks that better, more
            experienced developers had built to make my apps better. Also, these
            guys had made all the security mistakes for me, exposed themselves
            to vulnerabilities, and patched them so I didn't have to. But which
            framework?
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, obviously Laravell if I was going to stick with PHP. But, I
            wasn't going to stick with PHP; I wanted to learn the newest
            shinyest thing. I wanted to learn a single language that could be
            applied to all aspects of an app. I wanted something I could build
            an app for the web, phones, tablets, Windows, and MacOS. Theres only
            one language that can literally do it all: Web Assembly. Im joking;
            of course it's Javascript, the one man band.
